# packdir
Quickly zip a directory with relative paths (compatible with common Zip tools).

This is a Go library to zip a directory in standard format with relative paths. It doesn't offer any fancy options yet and has not been tested very extensively. Tests will be added later.

## TODO

In the future this package will allow you to unzip a snapshot, maintain some meta information, and will be tested extensively in order to make it suitable for production use. For now, it kind of works but use it at your own risk.
